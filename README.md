# Dig-grasping

## 1. Overview
This package presents an autonomous system for singulating and picking thin profile objects, for example, Go stones and capsules, from dense clutter. It is an implementation of **Dig-Grasping**, a new robotic manipulation technique for simultaneously singulating and picking objects from clutter, by leveraging planar quasistatic pushing as a way of direct physical interaction between the object to pick and the robot. As will be provided in this package, dig-grasping exhibits a gripper design with digit asymmetry, realized as a two-fingered gripper with finger length differences. Beyond picking, dig-grasping also presents more complex tasks such as autonomous pick-and-place of Go stones and pick-and-pack of capsules, which are included in this package.
